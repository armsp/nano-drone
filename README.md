# Nano Long Range
This project takes its inspiration from daveC's original design and modifies it substantially for my own experiments. It was really fun to get it to fly with open source firmwares.

# Firmwares
[x] Betaflight
[ ] Inav - need to test but should work
[ ] Ardupilot
[ ] Pixhawk

## Pixhawk
The final goal is to get Pixhawk working on it - the reduced features version due to a STM32F405 MCU - and modify it for my needs.

## Deep Learning
I also want to have a raspberry pi/nvidia compute unit integrated for vision tasks

# Flight Controller
JHEMCU AIO ExpressLRS (STM32F405)

# Auto Pilot
Need to work on integrating R-Pi/NVIDIA compute with a 1S Li-Ion cell.

# Autonomous Missions
Mission Planner / QGround Control

# Radio Link
ExpressLRS

# Sensors
[x] Range Finder
[ ] Thermal Cam
[x] Barometer
[x] GPS


# Video Link
5GHz, proprietary. Open hardware but protocol is proprietary. Need to work to make it open source
